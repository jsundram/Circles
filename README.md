Circles
=======

This is just a sketch of a bunch of circles floating around a screen.

It was inspired by Martin Wattenberg's talk, "What data scientists can learn from data artists" (http://bit.ly/SFx63x). In the talk, Martin describes an exercise where he asks a room full of novice computer programmers to draw circles with code. I decided it might be fun, and spent about an hour writing my own with Processing.

Features:

 1. You can add circles by clicking
 2. The color scheme for new circles varies as you move the mouse around the screen.
